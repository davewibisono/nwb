intro_section:
  content: Help us improve our documentation!  Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) is
    hosting its first documentation hackathon. The goal of the event is to
    jointly work on everything related to enhancing documentation for NWB and
    tools that support NWB. The event is for users and developers alike. We
    welcome participants of all experience levels, whether you are new to NWB,
    an expert user, or a tool developer. Help us make NWB better by improving
    documentation. Docathons are a great way to learn more about NWB, meeting
    people, and helping to improve NWB for everyone.
